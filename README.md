# 🧭 Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process that involves creating simplified visual layouts of a digital interface—such as a website or mobile app—before any detailed design or development begins. These low-detail sketches focus on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, images, or typography.
Wireframes serve as blueprints that help designers, developers, and stakeholders:
* Understand the placement of key elements like buttons, menus, and content blocks
* Align on user flow and navigation early in the design process
* Identify usability challenges before investing in high-fidelity design or code
By using tools like Figma, wireframing enables teams to collaborate effectively, reduce design risks, and ensure that the final product meets user needs with clarity and purpose.

### 🧩 Key Elements of Wireframing
Wireframes are simplified visual guides that outlline the structure and funtionality of a digital interface. it helps designers and developers plan user experience before going into the main or detailed design.

1. 🗂️ Layout Structure:
Defines the overall arrangement of components on the screen. It sets the visual hierarchy and guides users through the interface.
2. 🧭 Navigation:
Shows how users move between different sections or pages of the system. It includes menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, and links.
3. 📝Content Placement:
 Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
4. ⚙️ Functionality:
Represents interactive components like forms, buttons, dropdowns, and search fields. It shows how users will engage with the system

## 🧱 Types of Wireframes

### 1. ✏️ Low-Fidelity Wireframes  
These are basic sketches or grayscale layouts that focus on structure, layout, and user flow. They are quick to create and ideal for early brainstorming and feedback.

### 2. 🎨 High-Fidelity Wireframes  
These are detailed, polished representations that closely resemble the final product. They include accurate spacing, typography, icons, and sometimes interactivity.

## 🛠️ Popular Wireframing Tools

Wireframing tools help designers quickly visualize and iterate on layout ideas before moving into detailed design or development. These tools support collaboration, speed, and clarity in the early stages of the design process.

### ⭐ Recommended Tool: Figma

**Figma** is a cloud-based design platform widely used for wireframing and prototyping. It offers:

- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same file simultaneously.
- **Component libraries**: Reusable design elements speed up wireframe creation.
- **Cross-platform access**: Works on any device with a browser—no installation needed.
- **Integration with FigJam**: Ideal for brainstorming and sketching low-fidelity wireframes.


The wireframe presented in this project is a **low-fidelity wireframe**, created to emphasize layout structure, navigation flow, and content placement without focusing on visual styling. It serves as a foundational blueprint for refining the user experience before moving into high-fidelity prototyping.
