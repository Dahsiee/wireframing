# 🧭 Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process that involves creating simplified visual layouts of a digital interface—such as a website or mobile app—before any detailed design or development begins. These low-detail sketches focus on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, images, or typography.
Wireframes serve as blueprints that help designers, developers, and stakeholders:
* Understand the placement of key elements like buttons, menus, and content blocks
* Align on user flow and navigation early in the design process
* Identify usability challenges before investing in high-fidelity design or code
By using tools like Figma, wireframing enables teams to collaborate effectively, reduce design risks, and ensure that the final product meets user needs with clarity and purpose.

### 🧩 Key Elements of Wireframing
Wireframes are simplified visual guides that outlline the structure and funtionality of a digital interface. it helps designers and developers plan user experience before going into the main or detailed design.
